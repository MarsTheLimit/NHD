                        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                            The 6502 is a processor from the 1970's, made by MOS Technology. Processors before 
                            the 6502 weren't as efficient as the 6502, and costed about 12 times more than it. 
                            The Intel 4004 CPU was lucky to be even counted as the first CPU, because it wasn't 
                            much better than a calculator chip. Chuck Peddle (creator of the 6502) said, "[I am] 
                            not trying to be negative about the guys that did itâ€¦ they are nothing more than 
                            calculator chips."
