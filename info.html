                    The 6502 Microprocessor was made in 1975, by Chuck Peddle. The 6502 was a part of the MOS
                    Technology 6500 family, and was the second generation. The 6502 was just $25 ($139.02 in
                    today's money) versus all of its competitors processors that were around $200 ($1,112.16
                    today). Not only this, but it also was 10 times better than the Motorola 6800 and the
                    Intel 4004 or 8008. There's a lot of details, but it all boils down to that the 6502 had
                    less instructions than the Motorola 6800. To be exact, the 6800 had 72, and the 6502 had
                    56. Having less instructions makes it take less time to loop through all of them and
                    get to the actual program.

                <h1>How It All Started</h1>
                <p>
                    Chuck Peddle was only introduced to computers when he went to the University of Maine in 
                    1960, and he knew that he wanted to work with them his whole life. He started working at
                    General Electric in 1970, and developed the electronic cash register. Pretty soon after, 
                    GE decided that there wasn't any money left in making computers. Chuck then started working
                    at Motorola. He was hired to help Tom Bennett and his team to finish the Motorola 6800. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technically speaking, the Intel 4004 was the first MPU (microprocessor unit). The 4004
                    wasn't any better than a calculator, though. The Motorola 6800 is a whole different story.
                    The 4004 could only do simple arithmetic (addition and subtraction). All you needed to do
                    was hook up the VCC pin and the GND pin and tell it what problem to do. The 6800 could do
                    that, and more. It had an 8-bit data bus, and a 16-bit address bus. It had a lot more
                    capability than the 4004. The problem with it was that it was still really expensive. 
                    It still cost $200. Chuck Peddle knew that they needed to make a less expensive MPU. He 
                    asked customers what they thought was a good price, and he got $25. He told Motorola they
                    needed to make a computer that was this cheap, but they told him to stop.
                </p><p>
                    Now, any normal person would have stopped there, but Chuck isn't any normal man. In 1974, 
                    he convinced 7 colleague to pack their bags and move to MOS Technology. Everyone who moved 
                    was Harry Bawcom, Wil Mathys, Rod Orgill, Ray Hirt, Mike Janes, Terry Holdt, and Bill 
                    Mensch. There, they made the line of 6500's. They came out with the 6501 in 1975. It was
                    sold at $25, just like Chuck had tried to get Motorola to do. They were making a lot of 
                    money off of the 6501, as you expect, Motorola was mad. The thing they could have made money 
                    off of had become their competition. They found that 6501 uses some ideas Motorola used, and 
                    they sued MOS for piracy. As soon as they got wind of lawyers getting involved, the owners
                    of MOS stepped back, and gave the company to the management team. MOS ended up paying 
                    Motorola $200000. Chuck and his team weren't done yet.
                </p><br/><h1>The 6502 Comes Out</h1><p>
                    A few months later, in September, MOS Technology came out with the 6502. This time, they didn't 
                    use any ideas from the 6800. The 6502 had 56 instructions, and was 12 times cheaper than the 
                    6800. In 1976, MOS Technology was bought by Commodore. Now MOS had professional marketing, and
                    access to a lot more money. In April of 1976, the Apple I came out. It used the 6502, and was way
                    more affordable for someone who wanted a computer in their house. Then in 1977, Atari used the 
                    6502 in the Atari 2600, and this really set the ball rolling for the home computer revolution.
                    Commodore made the Commodore PET, which in today's money sold for $3924.75. In the early 1980's, 
                    the NES, Commodore 64, BBC Micro, Apple II, Atari Lynx, Atari 8-bit family, and many others were
                    made. So many companies were using the 6502 because it was cheap, and no really big companies were
                    looking to Motorola or Intel's expensive processors. As a result of this, the price of processors 
                    had to drop to compete with the 6502.

                <br/><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>
                    The 6502 processor found its way into many iconic machines, and it is the reason you have a
                    computer or phone that you are using to read this. It was fast and affordable, which made the price
                    of processors to drop. The 6502 was a very important part in the history of computers.
